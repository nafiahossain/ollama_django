## Setup Instructions

  1. **Clone the repository**:
  
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/nafiahossain/ollama_django.git
      cd django
      ```

  2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
  
      Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
      
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
      ```

  3. **Install dependencies**:

      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
      
      or,
     
      ```bash
      pip install django psycopg2-binary sqlalchemy python-dotenv pillow requests
      ```
     
  4. **Set up environment variables**:
  
      Ensure you have a .env (rename the .env.sample to .env, then add your credentials) file at the root of the Django project containing the following:
      
      ```env
      SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

      DB_NAME=yourdatabase
      DB_USER=username
      DB_PASSWORD=password
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_PORT=5433
      
      DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5433/yourdatabase
      ```

      **You can use the previously created database for the scrapy project to store the data migrated through this django project. So, no need to create a new database.**
      Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running, and the database specified in the .env file exists.
     
  5. **Run migrations**:
  
      Apply the database migrations:
      
      ```bash
      python manage.py makemigrations property_app
      python manage.py migrate
      ```

  6. **Load initial scrapy data**:
  
      You can use the custom management command to migrate data from the existing PostgreSQL database. Before running this command, make sure to Replace your scrapy local image directory with the actual path where        it was stored. If, the django folder and the trip_scraper folder is in the same directory (as shown in the [Project Structure](#project-structure)), then keep it as it is.

      ```python
      # property_app/migrate_scrapy_data.py
  
      # Path to your local image directory
        LOCAL_IMAGE_DIR = os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, '../trip_scraper/trip_scraper/images/full/')
      ```
      
      After data migration, the images will be saved in this directory:

      ```python
      # property_project/settings.py.py
  
      # Media files (Images, etc)
      MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
      MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
      ```
      If you want, you can change this directory as per your need.
     
      If the scrapy image directory setup is done, then run this command to migrate data from the existing scrapy database:

     ```bash
      python manage.py migrate_scrapy_data
      ```

  8. **Create an admin user**:
  
      To use the admin panel, First youâ€™ll need to create a user who can login to the admin site. Run the following command:
        
      ```bash
      python manage.py createsuperuser
      ```
    
      Enter your desired username, email address, and password. You will be asked to enter your password twice, the second time as a confirmation of the first. Using this info, you can log in to the admin panel and       perform CRUD operation on the migrated data.

  9. **Run the development server**:
  
      Start the Django development server:
      
      ```bash
      python manage.py runserver
      ```
    
      Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to see the application. To perfrom CRUD operation on data, you'll need to log in to the admin panel which is [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/). 

     - Output:

        - Images: Images migrated and stored stored in a directory called `/media/`.
        - Database: Migrated hotel data stored in 'yourdatabase', in the PostgreSQL database.
        - Django Admin Interface: Migrated data can be seen on the admin interface.


## Usage
  - **Home Page**: The home page is accessible at the root URL [/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
  - **Admin Interface**: Access the Django admin at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) to manage properties, locations, amenities, and images.


## Testing

After running the server, check the [Django admin interface](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) to view all the migrated data. There will be three models, Properties, Amenities, and Locations. You can perform CRUD operations on these models. Also check your database and image directory whether the data was migrated or not.
